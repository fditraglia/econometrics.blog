My name is Frank DiTraglia and this is my collection of assorted rants and musings on econometrics, statistics, and related topics. I'm an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Oxford, a Fellow and Tutor of Lady Margaret Hall, and a visiting researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. My academic website is <https://ditraglia.com> and you can follow me on twitter [@economictricks](https://twitter.com/economictricks). My collected teaching materials are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@economictricks), my [teaching website](https://ditraglia.com/teaching/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/fditraglia/).
