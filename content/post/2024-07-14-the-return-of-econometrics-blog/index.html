<p>After a year-long hiatus, I’m excited to return to regular blogging about econometrics! I have a long list of posts that I’m eager to write, and I hope you’ll find them interesting. To whet your appetite, here’s a preview of some of the topics I plan to cover in the coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bayesian versus Frequentist Approaches to Unit Roots</li>
<li>How Not To Do Regression Adjustment</li>
<li>Understanding the James-Stein Estimator</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, I have a few econometrics-related announcements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I’ll be teaching a summer course on causal inference at Oxford this September. If you’re interested in attending here are the <a href="https://ouess.web.ox.ac.uk/event/treatment-effects-beyond-the-basics-econometrics">registration details</a> and here’s the <a href="https://www.treatment-effects.com/beyond/">course website</a>.</li>
<li>I’m currently running a virtual summer reading group on Bayesian Econometrics that will continue at least until September and potentially beyond, depending on interest. If you have an email address that ends in <code>.ox.ac.uk</code> you can self-register <a href="https://edstem.org/us/join/6j2hay">here</a>. If you don’t have an Oxford email address, send me an email and I’ll add you manually.</li>
<li><a href="https://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0610/">Martin Weidner</a> and I recently kicked of an initiative to change the way that research in econometrics is assessed. To find out more, visit <a href="https://sqare.org/">sqare.org</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m looking forward to getting back to regular posting. If you have any special requests, please add them in the comments below.</p>
