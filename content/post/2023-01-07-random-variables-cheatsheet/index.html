<p>To do well in an econometrics or statistics course at any level, you need to have a large number of simple properties of random variables at your fingertips. Some years back I made a handout containing the most important properties for my undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania. In the hopes that this might be of use to others, Iâ€™ve released an <a href="https://github.com/fditraglia/random-variables-cheatsheet/blob/main/random-variables-cheatsheet.pdf">updated pdf on github</a>. You can fork the repository <a href="https://github.com/fditraglia/random-variables-cheatsheet">here</a>. If you spot any errors or want to suggest any additions, feel free to raise an <a href="https://github.com/fditraglia/random-variables-cheatsheet/issues">issue</a> or send me a <a href="https://github.com/fditraglia/random-variables-cheatsheet/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>
