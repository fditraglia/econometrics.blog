To do well in an econometrics or statistics course at any level, you need to have a large number of simple properties of random variables at your fingertips. Some years back I made a handout containing the most important properties for my undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania. In the hopes that this might be of use to others, I've released an [updated pdf on github](https://github.com/fditraglia/random-variables-cheatsheet/blob/main/random-variables-cheatsheet.pdf). You can fork the repository [here](https://github.com/fditraglia/random-variables-cheatsheet). If you spot any errors or want to suggest any additions, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/fditraglia/random-variables-cheatsheet/issues) or send me a [pull request](https://github.com/fditraglia/random-variables-cheatsheet/pulls).
